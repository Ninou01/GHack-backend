The Ministry of Commerce and Export Promotion informs all economic operators involved in importing raw materials, products, and goods intended for resale in their original state that, starting from March 13, 2022, new documents will be required in addition to the usual importation dossier. This information is conveyed through a statement posted on the ministry's Facebook page.

Henceforth, along with the standard documents, it will be necessary to provide a copy of the certificate of compliance with the conditions and modalities for conducting the importation of raw materials, products, and goods intended for resale in their original state, as well as a copy of the domiciled invoice. Moreover, in the case of importing non-homogeneous cargoes, a copy of the packing list must also be included in the dossier.

These new measures are implemented in accordance with the provisions of Article 30 of Law 09-03 on consumer protection and fraud prevention, as well as Article 03 of Executive Decree 05-467, which sets out the conditions and procedures for border control of the conformity of imported products. The aim of these measures is to regulate imports and combat illegal practices in foreign trade.

############

7. **Submission and Acceptance of the Importation File:**

The conformity of products is verified based on a dossier submitted by the importer or their duly authorized representative to the relevant border inspection authority under the administration responsible for consumer protection and fraud prevention.

The importation dossier must include the following documents:

- The import declaration of the product duly completed by the concerned importer;
- A certified copy of the commercial registry extract;
- A certified copy of the invoice;
- A copy of any other document required by current regulations relating to the conformity of imported products.

Fraud prevention agents ensure the acceptability of the product importation dossier by verifying:

- The correspondence between the declared imported product and the commercial activity code on the commercial registry extract;
- The absence of the importer's name in the national register of individuals involved in fraudulent activities.

An acknowledgment of receipt is issued to the importer or their duly authorized representative upon confirmation of the acceptability of the dossier.

############

8. **Control of Imported Product Conformity Involves:**

1. Documentary Control.
2. Visual Inspection of the Products.
3. Analytical Control in case of suspected hidden defects that can only be determined through analytical methods.

The operations for verifying the conformity of imported products can be conducted jointly and simultaneously in a harmonized and coordinated manner among the various services involved at the borders.

Following the aforementioned control operations, the importer is issued, as the case may be:

- Either an admission authorization for the imported product (in case of product conformity).
- Or a decision to refuse admission of the imported product (in case of non-conformity of the product).

The time limit for documentary and/or visual inspections shall not exceed forty-eight (48) working hours from the date of completion of the inspection.

This period may be extended, if necessary, for the duration required for analytical control, provided it does not exceed the maximum duration of stay in the warehouse or temporary storage area, as stipulated by current legislation and regulations.

############

9. **Administrative Appeals and Destination of Blocked Products at Borders:**

To contest the reasons for refusal of admission or to request the destination for non-compliant products, the importer has avenues for administrative appeals, as appropriate:

1. With the Territorially Competent Provincial Trade Directorate within 8 days from the date of notification of refusal of admission of the product following documentary and/or visual inspections.
   
2. With the Territorially Competent Regional Trade Directorate, to determine the fate of the product definitively refused admission.

3. With the Central Administration (Directorate General of Economic Investigations and Fraud Repression) if the appeal filed with the Regional Directorate of Commerce does not result in action or remains unresolved.

a. **With the Provincial Trade Directorate:**

The appeal to the Provincial Trade Directorate involves contesting the reason for refusal of admission and must be lodged within a period of eight (8) days from the date of notification of the refusal decision.

The Provincial Trade Directorate has a period of 4 working days from the date of the appeal to confirm or overturn the reasons for the refusal decision.

If the reasons for refusing admission of the product are overturned, the border inspection chief must notify the cancellation of the product's admission refusal decision. Otherwise, the Provincial Trade Director informs the appellant and the inspection chief.

b. **With the Regional Trade Directorate:**

The appeal to the Regional Trade Directorate is made in the case of definitive refusal of product admission.

The appellant can appeal regarding the destination for the non-compliant product:

- Bringing it into compliance.

10. **Authorization for Customs Clearance of Refurbished Production Lines**

Given the evolution of the international context marked by recession and crisis leading to the closure of numerous production units, the government has decided to establish a framework allowing our investors to seize the opportunities thus offered.

This decision has resulted in the granting of customs clearance authorization, by exceptional derogation from the Minister in charge of investment, for the consumption of refurbished production lines (Article 54 of the Supplementary Finance Law for 2010).

**Concerned Equipment**
Refurbished Production Line: A refurbished production line refers to equipment constituting a homogeneous, refurbished, and operational production line.

Production lines refer to those consisting of extraction, manufacturing, or packaging of products.

The production line, as defined in this instruction, must have undergone renovation confirmed by an independent authorized inspection and control body.

The production line must be consumed by the operator for the specific needs of their activity and within the strict deadlines necessary for its effective operation.

**Beneficiaries**
Eligible for this authorization are economic operators duly registered in the trade register whose activity is directly related to that for which the production line covered by this instruction is intended.

Beneficiaries must also have and justify an infrastructure suitable for the exploitation of the imported line. Economic operators refer to Algerian legal entities.

**Granting Procedures for Customs Clearance Authorization**
Authorization for customs clearance of refurbished production lines may be granted by exceptional derogation from the Minister in charge of Investment, based on a detailed report prepared by the Technical Committee. The Technical Committee is established as a "refurbished production lines" technical committee under the Minister in charge of investment. This committee is responsible for processing requests for customs clearance authorizations of refurbished production lines based on the documentation provided in support of the request. This committee formulates a technical opinion and any other appropriate recommendations. The committee may, as necessary, seek the assistance of experts or any person likely to provide insight. The committee must base its opinion on the list of activities not eligible for the benefits provided for in ordinance No. 01-03 of August 20, 2001, as mentioned in executive decree No. 07-08 of January 11, 2007, amended and supplemented. Chaired by the Minister in charge of Investment or their representative, the committee consists of representatives from the following structures under the same ministry:
